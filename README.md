# MNIST Handwritten Digit Reconstruction using Encoder-Decoder

This repository contains an implementation of an **encoder-decoder architecture** for reconstructing handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The model is designed to provide an intuitive understanding of how encoder-decoder models work in feature extraction and data transformation.

## 📌 Overview
The encoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional latent space, and the decoder reconstructs the original image from this compressed representation. This project demonstrates the fundamental concept behind **encoder-decoder architectures** and their ability to learn meaningful representations of data.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook to train and visualize the encoder-decoder model:
```bash
jupyter notebook mnist_encoder_decoder.ipynb
```

## 🎯 Model Architecture
- **Encoder:** A sequential model with dense (fully connected) layers that reduce the dimensionality of the input.
- **Decoder:** A sequential model with dense layers that reconstruct the original input from the encoded representation.

## 📊 Results
You can visualize the reconstructed digits directly in the notebook.
